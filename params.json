{"name":"VersaTile","tagline":"Algorithmic Self-Assembly Simulator","body":"VersaTile Self-Assembly Simulator - [Download the latest release](https://github.com/ericmichael/polyomino/releases)\r\n=========\r\n\r\nVersaTile is a cross-platform simulator for various models of algorithmic self-assembly.\r\n\r\nIt was written by the [Algorithmic Self-Assembly Research Group](http://faculty.utpa.edu/orgs/asarg/) at the University of Texas - Pan American.\r\n\r\nThe models it currently supports are:\r\n\r\n  - abstract Tile Assembly Model\r\n  - dupled Tile Assembly Model\r\n  - hex Tile Assembly Model\r\n  - polyomino Tile Assembly Model\r\n  \r\n  \r\nIt also supports:\r\n\r\n  - temperature programming\r\n  - concentration programming\r\n  - negative interactions (attachments only)\r\n  - a run-time model\r\n  - flexible glues\r\n  \r\nIt allows for:\r\n\r\n - 'Playing' through the assembly process\r\n - 'Rewinding' the assembly process\r\n - 'Fast-Forwarding'\r\n - 'Stepping through' the assembly process\r\n - 'Zooming' and 'Panning'\r\n - Creation of Tile Sets through our GUI editor\r\n - Visualization of the 'frontier'\r\n\r\n\r\nVersaTile is currently under rapid-development and is in pre-alpha.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion\r\n----\r\n\r\npre-alpha\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nPolyomino contains a number of examples in the *com.asarg.polysim.examples* package:\r\n\r\n* *TetrisSimulation.java* - Basic example showing colored polyomino tiles\r\n* *RNGUnBoundedSimulation.java* - Example showing selection of random number generation using the ATAM model","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
